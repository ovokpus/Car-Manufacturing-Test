# Car-Manufacturing-Test
Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.

## Goal of this project: Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.

### Problem Statement

Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include the passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium carmakers.

Mercedes-Benz is the leader in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.

To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.

Our end-goal is to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench using model prediction.

This Project is broken down into the following Sections:

#### Defining the Problem



### Dataset Information

The Datasets provided contains 7 features which can help us determine salaries of various job roles. Salary is thus identified as the target value of our prediction.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This involves looking at the Data Summaries and Visualizations in order to:

1. Examine the Data
2. Discover patterns and relationships between the features
3. Identify the types of data
4. Clean up the Data


Below is an overview of the Train Dataframe (after merging the 'train_features' and 'train_target' files):
